## Hard Part (only some of you can solve these - MUST TRY)
1. What does the following code print, and why?
```
console.log(x, y);
var x = 'first';
let y = 'second';
{
  var x = 'third';
  let y = 'fourth';
}
console.log(x, y);
```

2. Consider this function. What happens when you call mystery()‚Äîdoes it log a value, or throw an error? Explain the reason.
```
function mystery() {
  console.log(secret);
  const secret = 'üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è';
}
mystery();
```

3. Predict the output (or errors) of this snippet. Write down each line‚Äôs result in order, and explain how hoisting and scope affect it.
```
var a = 1;
function foo() {
  a = 2;
  console.log(a);
  var a;
  console.log(a);
}
foo();
console.log(a);
```
